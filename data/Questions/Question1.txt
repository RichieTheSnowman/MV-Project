How does Fredrick Douglass learn to read and write and who taught him?

Frederick Douglass was initially taught how to read by his master's wife, Mrs. Auld. Mrs. Auld taught Frederick the alphabet and small words before her husband forbade her from teaching Frederick. 
You are fucking stupid, use wikipedia loser, you don’t have to go on a public forum.
I think because of one of Fredrick's masters.
