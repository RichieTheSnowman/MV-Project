Is integration harder to learn than differentiation?

Yes. Differentiation is algorithmic. The algorithm isn’t explicitly described, but if you understand algebra, you’ll come up with it on your own, given the basic rules for derivations, and the chain rule. Integration is inversion of differentiation. There is a loss of information in differentiation, which creates subtleties. While there is an algorithm for integration, it’s never taught because it’s complicated, and it requires as one of its steps, the determination of whether or not a function is identically 0. That’s not generally computable, for recursive functions, which opens another can of worms. So calculus classes teach a bag of tricks, and expect you to develop the pattern recognition skills to know which trick to use when. Because reasons.
Conceptually, no.
Yes, but only slightly harder than differentiation. Differentiation is rule-based. Once we know the derivatives of the powers of x, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, the product, quotient, and chain rule, we just apply these rules to differentiate any function. Integration is an art. In integration, you have to recognize which type of form or pattern is in the integrand and then start with one of the about 10 or so techniques. After applying one of those techniques it may change into a different integrand. Now you apply another technique and so on. The way we study integration affects how good we become in integration. There are some good books such as Calculus by Edwards and Penney, which goes about in the best possible way to teach integration. There are some other books that completely screws up the student’s mind. In the early stages when you see a new type of integral, there is an order in which you must try the different techniques. For example, always look for a substitution technique first. A student who follows these steps will always be good in integration.
